# Testing Methodology

The testing methodology for the Urban.Scooter project follows a structured process divided into four main stages:

## 1. Preparation and Analysis
- **Documentation Study**: Examine the application documentation, which contains lists of requirements, designs, and URLs to which the application sends data.
- **Mind Map Creation**: Develop a mind map to visualize the requirements and organize testing information.
- **Resource Division**: Break down application resources into atomic blocks and define test objects.

## 2. Test Design
- **Test Planning**: Design tests to cover all identified requirements.
- **Application of Testing Techniques**: Use equivalence classes, boundary values, and decision tables as needed.
- **Test Optimization**: Minimize the number of tests performed, focusing on UI tests and resource logic.

## 3. Test Execution
- **Test Execution**: Conduct the tests and record the results as **PASSED** or **FAILED**.
- **Bug Reporting**: If a test fails, create a bug report in Jira and enter the ID in the results table.

## 4. Request Verification
- **Use of Tools**: Utilize tools such as DevTools or Postman to verify requests to specific URLs.
