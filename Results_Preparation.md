# Results Preparation

Preparing the results of the tests involves documenting and organizing the information collected during the testing process.

## Results Structure
The results of the tests should be organized in the following tabs of the template spreadsheet:

### 1. Tab "Task 2: Checklist"
- This tab should contain the results of the executed tests and the created bug reports. It is essential that each test is recorded as **PASSED** or **FAILED**, with details about the tests performed.

### 2. Tab "Task 2: Validation Data"
- This tab is dedicated to the validation of fields on the "Place Order" screen. Input data and expected results should be documented for easy review.

### 3. Tab "Task 3: API Checklist"
- The results of the API tests should be documented in this tab. Each tested requirement must have its result recorded, along with the corresponding bug reports.

## Attachments
In addition to the spreadsheets, include:
- **Link to the Google Spreadsheet**: To facilitate access to the results.
- **Image of the Mind Map**: For visual reference during the analysis.
- **Links to Bug Reports in Jira**: To track the status of reported bugs.
